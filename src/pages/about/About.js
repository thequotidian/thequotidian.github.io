          <p>What's this blog all about? Well, that's a work in progress (as most
          things are). Broadly, I want to be more intentional in noticing the
          things around me that bring me joy, and give me a sense of "being human"...
          this blog is a means to documenting those things.</p>
          <p>Updates to be made here once I have something more meaningful, and
          hopefully snappier, to say.</p>
